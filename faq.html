                            <p>Until then, you can still use MidPay for your client payments while managing subcontractors through your existing processes. Many contractors find that the improved cash flow from using MidPay with clients enables them to pay their subcontractors more promptly.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Payment Security:</strong> Your funds are held in secure, FDIC-insured escrow accounts and only released when work is completed to your satisfaction.</li>
                                <li><strong>Milestone-Based Payments:</strong> Instead of large upfront payments or lump sums, you pay incrementally as specific phases of work are completed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Verification Process:</strong> You review and approve completed work before payment is released, ensuring you only pay for quality results.</li>
                                <li><strong>Contractor Verification:</strong> All contractors on MidPay undergo a verification process to confirm their credentials and business information.</li>
                                <li><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> If issues arise, our platform provides a structured process for resolving disputes fairly and efficiently.</li>

                            <p>If you're not satisfied with completed work, you can decline to approve the milestone and provide specific feedback about what needs to be corrected. The contractor will then have the opportunity to address the issues before requesting approval again.</p>
                            <p>If a resolution can't be reached directly, MidPay's Proactive Milestone Communication team will help mediate the situation.

This personal approach ensures that issues are addressed promptly and fairly.</p>
                            <p>The funds remain in escrow until all concerns are resolved, ensuring your investment is protected throughout the process.</p>

                            <p>After our launch in April 2025, you'll be able to search our directory of verified MidPay contractors in your area. You can filter by specialty, view ratings and reviews from other homeowners, and contact contractors directly through the platform.</p>
                            <p>If you already have a contractor in mind who doesn't use MidPay, you can invite them to join the platform. Many contractors are open to using MidPay when they understand the benefits it provides for both parties.</p>

                            <p>Construction projects often evolve, and MidPay is designed to accommodate changes. If your project scope changes after it's started, your contractor can create a change order within the platform. This will outline the additional work, associated costs, and any timeline adjustments.</p>
                            <p>You'll review and approve the change order, and then fund any additional amount to the escrow account. The change order becomes part of the project agreement, with its own milestones and payment schedule if needed.</p>
                            <p>This process ensures that all changes are documented, agreed upon, and properly funded, preventing misunderstandings and disputes.</p>

                            <p>The MidPay escrow process works in these steps:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The contractor creates a project agreement with defined milestones and payment amounts.</li>
                                <li>The homeowner reviews and approves the agreement.</li>
                                <li>The homeowner funds the escrow account via ACH transfer, credit card, or wire transfer.</li>
                                <li>Funds are held in a secure, FDIC-insured escrow account.</li>
                                <li>As the contractor completes each milestone, they submit verification (photos, videos, inspection documents).</li>
                                <li>The homeowner reviews the completed work and approves the milestone.</li>
                                <li>Upon approval, funds for that milestone are released from escrow to the contractor within 24 hours.</li>
                                <li>This process repeats for each milestone until the project is complete.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>This structured approach ensures that funds are secure, work is verified, and payments are released promptly for completed milestones.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>Homeowners can fund their escrow accounts using several payment methods:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>ACH Bank Transfer:</strong> Direct transfer from a bank account (no fee)</li>
                                <li><strong>Credit/Debit Card:</strong> Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover (3% processing fee)</li>
                                <li><strong>Wire Transfer:</strong> For larger projects or international payments (varies by bank)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>For larger projects, we recommend ACH or wire transfers to minimize processing fees. The platform will guide you through the funding process and provide clear information about any applicable fees.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>Milestone payments are structured based on the specific phases of your construction project. The contractor will define these milestones in the project agreement, typically following industry-standard project phases.</p>
                            <p>For example, a kitchen remodel might have these milestones:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Demolition and preparation (15% of total)</li>
                                <li>Rough plumbing and electrical (20% of total)</li>
                                <li>Cabinets and countertops (30% of total)</li>
                                <li>Appliance installation (20% of total)</li>
                                <li>Final touches and cleanup (15% of total)</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Each milestone has a specific dollar amount assigned to it, and funds are released incrementally as each milestone is completed and verified. This approach ensures that payment is aligned with project progress.</p>

                            <p>While your funds are in escrow, they are held in FDIC-insured accounts separate from MidPay's operating funds. The money remains secure and untouched until milestone completion is verified and approved.</p>
                            <p>Escrow funds do not earn interest, as they are held in non-interest-bearing accounts to comply with escrow regulations. This ensures that the exact amount funded is available for release to the contractor upon milestone completion.</p>
                            <p>You can view the status of your escrow account at any time through the MidPay platform, seeing exactly how much has been funded, released, and remains in escrow.</p>

                            <p>Yes, if a project is cancelled before all milestones are completed, any remaining funds in escrow will be returned to the homeowner. The refund process is as follows:</p>

                                <li>Either party can initiate a project cancellation through the platform.</li>
                                <li>Both parties must agree to the cancellation terms, including which milestones have been completed and which remain unfinished.</li>
                                <li>Funds for completed and approved milestones remain with the contractor.</li>
                                <li>Funds for incomplete milestones are returned to the homeowner within 5 business days.</li>
                                <li>If there's a dispute about cancellation terms, our dispute resolution process will help reach a fair solution.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Contractors receive payments through their preferred payout method, which they set up when creating their MidPay account. Available payout options include:</p>

                                <li><strong>Direct Deposit (ACH):</strong> Funds transferred directly to the contractor's bank account (1-2 business days)</li>

                            <p>Once a milestone is approved, the funds are released from escrow and processed according to the contractor's chosen payout method. Standard transfers typically take 1-2 business days to appear in the contractor's bank account.</p>

                            <p>If a homeowner is unresponsive after multiple contact attempts, our team will conduct a review of the submitted documentation and may release payment after a reasonable waiting period, provided the work appears to meet the specifications outlined in the contract.</p>

                                <li>You can request a complete record of all project documentation, communications, and dispute resolution attempts from the platform.</li>

                                <li>Funds that are in dispute will remain in escrow until directed by a court order or legal settlement.</li>
                                <li>MidPay will comply with all valid legal orders regarding the disposition of escrow funds.</li>

                            <p>If you're on the Premium Plan, cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing cycle. Any escrow fees for completed milestones are non-refundable.</p>
